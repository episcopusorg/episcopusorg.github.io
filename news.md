### Episcopus at ICMS/Kalamazoo in 2021 

#### S352 / Friday, May 14, 1:00 p.m. EDT

Brevia on Bishops and the Secular Clergy 

For the third year in a row, we propose a lightning-round panel that gives up to 10 scholars ca. 3 minutes each--strictly enforced!--to present informally a current research idea. The audience and session participants will then respond with suggestions about where to take the ideas. This panel, modeled initially on similar successful sessions at the American Historical Association and aims to foster research in its very early stages and to generate paper proposals for the International Congress in 2022.  

This year’s Brevia will include presentations by:

- William H. Campbell
- Elizabeth M. Swedo
- Paweł Figurski
- Kyle Cooper Lincoln
- Ingrid Lunnan Nødseth
- Katherine Clark Walter
