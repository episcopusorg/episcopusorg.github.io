## Join Episcopus at (ICMS) Kalamazoo and (IMC) Leeds in 2022 

### Kalamazoo: Brevia on Bishops and the Secular Clergy 

For the fourth year in a row, we propose a lightning-round panel that gives up to 10 scholars ca. 3 minutes each to present a current research idea. The audience and session participants will then respond with suggestions about where to take the ideas. This panel aims to foster research in its very early stages and to generate paper proposals for the International Congress in 2023. **Submit title and a short description of work-in-progress by Sept. 7 to Evan A. Gatti (egatti@elon.edu).** *This session is classified as a roundtable event*

### Kalamazoo: Cusanus and Ecclesiology [Co-sponsored with American Cusanus Society]

The late medieval humanist Nicholas of Cusa wavered between support for general councils against papal authority before moving cautiously but not completely to a nuanced papalist position. This panel will explore the development of Cusan’s careful ecclesiology from his period as a diocesan bishop to papal advisor. Special attention will be paid to the influences on him that impacted the changes in his thinking based on theoretical considerations but also political and practical implications in the context of the mid-fifteenth century recovery of papal authority after the conclusion of the Great Western Schism. **Submit abstracts by Sept. 7 to  Christopher Bellitto (cbellitt@kean.edu).** *Please note that the topic need NOT be Cusanus or limited to the 15th c.*

### Kalamazoo: Mendicant Friars and the Secular Church: Controversy, Coexistence, Collaboration [Co-sponsored with Franciscan Institute, St. Bonaventure Univ.]

From c. 1215 onward, the Latin church had two parallel structures for reaching the laity, the seculars and the mendicants. As the latter exploded in numbers and popularity, the two became rivals, sometimes espousing radically different agendas for reform and concepts of the nature of the church itself. From time to time, this broke into open conflict. But the two could often co-operate, as when a parish priest invited a friar to preach, or even overlap, as when a friar was elected to the episcopate. Papers are invited that address the nature of these complex relationships. **Submit abstracts by Sept. 7 to William H. Campbell, (whc7@pitt.edu).**

### Leeds: "Becoming the Bishop: Examinations of Episcopal Self-Fashioning" [Co-Sponsored by Episcopus and the PSALM Network]
This session will explore the many ways that medieval bishops responded to local, regional, and institutional influences in order to create effective, individualized identities. While the office of the medieval bishop outlines certain rights, privileges, and responsibilities, how one managed those rights, privileges, and responsibilities varies greatly. At times, this variation was in response to local needs, conflicts, or traditions, but in other cases, the actions of a bishop seemed to point towards ambition, piety, or some other notable characteristic of a historical individual. By examining how a bishop defined himself within and beyond the office, we gain a better understanding of which aspects of a historical bishop are defined by the legacy of the apostolic office and which might be unique to the men who occupied it. **Please submit abstracts for 15 to 20-minute presentations to egatti@elon.edu by September 15, 2021.**

### Leeds: On the Edge: Approaching Borders and Borderlands in the Middle Ages
Papers in the session will include examinations of marginal or marginalized content as well as methodological models that encourage us to shift or reframe, the notion of the Middle Ages. The space on either side of a border, borderlands, is a place of boundary formation and transgression, of dynamic mixing and interaction, of the exercise of and resistance to power. We welcome papers that embrace the complexity of borderlands in the middle ages, the people who lived in them, and the objects created by them. **Please submit abstracts for 15 to 20-minute presentations to egatti@elon.edu by September 15, 2021.** *Note that papers proposed for this session do NOT have to deal explicitly with bishops or the secular clergy.*

### CFP Annual Symposium On Medieval and Renaissance Studies

Hosted by St. Louis University, 20-22 June 2022, in St. Louis, MO, USA. This is a physical, in-person conference. Episcopus is excited to offer the following session at the upcoming Annual Symposium on Medieval and Renaissance Studies, hosted by St. Louis University, 20-22 June 2022, in St. Louis, MO, USA. This is a physical, in-person conference. **Please submit a paper title, abstract, along with your name, brief biography to the session organizer, Benjamin Wand (benjamin.wand@slu.edu) by December 31, 2021.**

### Clergy in their Communities: Charisma, Compassion, Conflict

From the village priest to metropolitan bishop, secular clergy were often at the center of their communities. Or were they? To what extent were clergy acting as spiritual guides, and how did their guidance impact their relationships with others? What role - social, pastoral, judicial, political, or other - did individual clergy prioritize in their own parish or diocese? To which social groups did clergy owe allegiance to, and how did they prioritize these allegiances? How did their judicial, economic, and political concerns impact their place in their parish, communities, or dioceses?

As spiritual guides, political actors, and members of families and social groups, secular clergy interacted with, managed, and often represented, members of their communities. These interactions were layered with expectations which impacted relationships, stemming from the often complex role clergy played in society. 

This session hopes to examine the variety of ways secular clergy throughout Europe interacted with their families, friends, and communities, along with the tensions, expectations, and contexts accompanying such interactions. Furthermore, it hopes to illuminate the strategies and mechanisms clergy used to manage their relationships, conduct pastoral care, or accomplish secular aims. Papers should address roles, interactions, kinship, social bonds, expectations, along with cultural or other views of these relationships, from late antiquity through the early modern period. Studies utilizing geographic or chronological comparisons are encouraged.
